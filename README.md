# clearspace
Remove unneeded files to clear space from your Debian/Ubuntu/RedHat/CentOS servers or VMs

Purpose
-------
I generate some custom VMs for testing and I like to keep the sizes as small as possible. Removing uneeded files manually is a pain so this script will automatically do it for you.

Inspiration
-----------
Danila Vershinin wrote a very interesting article and script on how to delete unneeded files from CentOS/RedHat:

Danila has indicated that he is developing an application/script to do this on his GitHub:

This is just my solution applying the above ideas.
