# clearspace
Remove unneeded files to clear space from your Debian/Ubuntu/RedHat/CentOS servers or VMs

Purpose
-------
I generate some custom VMs for testing and I like to keep the sizes as small as possible. Removing uneeded files manually is a pain so this script will automatically do it for you.
